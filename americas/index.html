Torquemada wrote <i>Monarchia indiana</i> when he was asked by his order to compile a history of their work and their laity. Torquemada relied on the writings of his colleagues and histories by native writers, such as Fernando Alva Ixtlilxochitl. The result is a compendium that bears many perspectives representing the American experience. The title page in <i>Monarchia indiana</i> is a recreation of a page from the <i>Rhetorica Christiana</i> (link to it) in which a preacher delivers a sermon with the aid of a screen above.

A Montauk man named Cockenoe served as his interpreter in the 1640s, and was then replaced by a Massachuset man, Job Nesuton, who worked with Eliot for nearly 25 years. Copies of this New Testament, likely produced in an edition of around 500, were distributed to the Algonquians to further their understanding of Christianity."

The material is then shown to Bishop Zumárraga, who then also accepts Guadalupe. The moment symbolizes the Christianizing of the Americas as Juan Diego, a native Mexican, accepts the cult of Guadalupe. Sylvia R. Santaballa argues that this history helped Creole efforts to codify la Virgen de Guadalupe as a multilayered symbol of “Mexican cultural identity” that was distinct from strictly European or indigenous culture."
