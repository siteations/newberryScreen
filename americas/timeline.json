Torquemada relied on the writings of his colleagues and histories by native writers, such as Fernando Alva Ixtlilxochitl. The result is a compendium that bears many perspectives representing the American experience. The title page in <i>Monarchia indiana</i> is a recreation of a page from the <i>Rhetorica Christiana</i> (link to it) in which a preacher delivers a sermon with the aid of a screen above.

Williams wrote the work on his journey from America to England to secure the charter for the Providence Plantations and Rhode Island."

The material is then shown to Bishop Zum\u00e1rraga, who then also accepts Guadalupe. The moment symbolizes the Christianizing of the Americas as Juan Diego, a native Mexican, accepts the cult of Guadalupe. Sylvia R. Santaballa argues that this history helped Creole efforts to codify la Virgen de Guadalupe as a multilayered symbol of \u201cMexican cultural identity\u201d that was distinct from strictly European or indigenous culture."
