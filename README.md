### To update exhibition files two options:

1. use git (single command, < minute per update)
2. download full folder, unzip, and replace original folder (depends on wifi speed)

#### Because updates will be distributed, it is better to grab all files, but should you want to only update specifics (after a clean install), you can see what has changed by exploring the commits. 
* Per commit, it will show the files & lines that have changed. 
* Figure out what was last updated (by date) and find commits after that date.
* Note, in each commit, the changed files. 
* Really, it's easier to just bulk download everything, unzip and replace only the changed files.


### As the download option is easy, but time consuming, the following guides non-git users through git based updating:
* download and install git on each machine (do this only once) from [the git site](https://git-scm.com/) or for more ui options [the github site](http://windows.github.com)
* instead of downloading a zip, navigate to where you want the files to sit on your desktop and right click for the option 'open git bash here'
* with git bash's command line interface open type in (for cloning this respositiory) 'git clone https://github.com/siteations/newberryScreen'
* this will download the folder of materials for you, akin to the manual zip download, so this only needs to be done once
* after the folder is downloaded, using git bash, navigate inside by typing 'cd newberryScreen' and notice the hidden '.git' folder
* at this point you should be parallel to the main 'index.html' file
* this is where you will want to be for updates. . . (so when updating, navigate here through your normal graphic user interface and right click, open git bash)
* to update with git bash, simply type 'git pull origin master'
* this command checks in with the git repository, looks at the commit history, and automatically downloads anything that has been updated
#### that's it - download git, clone the repository once, and continually update with 'git pull origin master'

* for addition git commands, see the cheatsheet and docs at https://git-scm.com/docs
